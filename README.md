For this challenge created the Javascript code for a random password generator.

Solutions/Notes
I started with creating my time block function to display today's date/time.
I then created my click event function for the save button to save data on the local storage
From there I created a function to update the classes for my time blocks to show the correct color depending on the time.
Lastly I created code to wrap up the storage for each of the time slots.
